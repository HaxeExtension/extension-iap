/**
 * Provides convenience methods and properties for in-app purchases (Android & iOS).
 * The methods and properties are static, so there's no need to instantiate an instance,
 * but an initialization is required prior to the first use.
 * Every method is asynchronous (non-blocking). The callbacks always fire events indicating
 * the success or failure of every operation.
 *
 * The first step is to initialize the extension. You do so by calling the {@link #initialize}
 * method. The result comes with a PURCHASE_INIT or PURCHASE_INIT_FAILED IAPEvent. Also, the
 * available property will tell if you can use the extension at any time.
 *
 * Although we aim to provide a unified API for every target, there are some differences that
 * required to leave platform exclusive methods and properties. So you'll find different workflows.
 *
 * Android workflow:
 * ----------------
 *
 * After initialization is complete, you will typically want to request an inventory of owned
 * items and subscriptions. See {@link #queryInventory} and related events. This method can also be
 * used to retrieve a detailed list of products.
 *
 * Then you may want to buy items with the {@link #purchase} method, and if the item is consumable,
 * the {@link #consume} method should be called after a successful purchase.
 *
 * iOS workflow:
 * ------------
 *
 * After initialization is complete, you will typically want request details about the products
 * being sold {@link #requestProductData}, and also probably try to restore non consumable
 * items previously purchased by the user using the {@link #restore} method.
 *
 * Then you may want to buy items with the {@link #purchase} method. You don't need to call the
 * consume method for iOS, but for consumable items you may want to locally erase the purchase from
 * the Inventory.
 *
 * You may want to check the IAPEvent, Purchase and ProductDetails classes to explore further.
 *
